# Character vectors 


<!--Original content: https://stat545.com/block028_character-data.html-->

## Character vectors: where they fit in

We've spent a lot of time working with big, beautiful data frames. That are clean and wholesome, like the Gapminder data.

But real life will be much nastier. You will bring data into R from the outside world and discover there are problems. You might think: how hard can it be to deal with character data? And the answer is: it can be very hard!

Here we discuss common remedial tasks for cleaning and transforming character data, also known as "strings". A data frame or tibble will consist of one or more *atomic vectors* of a certain class. This lesson deals with things you can do with vectors of class `character`.

## Resources

I start with this because we cannot possibly do this topic justice in a short amount of time. Our goal is to make you aware of broad classes of problems and their respective solutions. Once you have a character problem in real life, these resources will be extremely helpful as you delve deeper.

### Manipulating character vectors

* [stringr package](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/).
  - A core package in the `tidyverse.` It is installed via `install.packages("tidyverse")` and also loaded via `library(tidyverse)`. Of course, you can also install or load it individually.
  - Main functions start with `str_`. Auto-complete is your friend.
  - Replacements for base functions re: string manipulation and regular expressions (see below).
  - Main advantages over base functions: greater consistency about inputs and outputs. Outputs are more ready for your next analytical task. 
* [tidyr package](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
  - Especially useful for functions that split one character vector into many and *vice versa*: `separate()`, `unite()`, `extract()`.
* Base functions: `nchar()`, `strsplit()`, `substr()`, `paste()`, `paste0()`.


### Regular expressions resources

A painful, horrible, but extremely powerful language for expressing patterns to match in text or for search-and-replace. Frequently described as "write only", because regular expressions are easier to write than to read/understand. And they are not particularly easy to write.

* We again prefer the `stringr` package over base functions. Why?
  - Wraps `stringi` functions, which is a great place to look if stringr isn't powerful enough.
  - Results come back in a form that is much friendlier for downstream work.
  - Start with the [Cheat Sheet](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf)!
* The Strings chapter] of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#strings) is a great resource.
* Older STAT 545 lessons on regular expressions have some excellent content. This lesson draws on them, but makes more rigorous use of stringr and uses example data that is easier to support long-term. Check out the STAT 545 website for links. 
* RStudio Cheat Sheet on [Regular Expressions in R](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf).
* Base functions: `grep()` and friends.


## Load the tidyverse, which includes stringr

```{r start_char_vectors}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Regex-free string manipulation with stringr and tidyr

Basic string manipulation tasks:

* Study a single character vector
  - How long are the strings?
  - Presence/absence of a literal string
* Operate on a single character vector
  - Keep/discard elements that contain a literal string
  - Split into two or more character vectors using a fixed delimiter
  - Snip out pieces of the strings based on character position
  - Collapse into a single string
* Operate on two or more character vectors
  - Glue them together element-wise to get a new character vector.

*`fruit`, `words`, and `sentences` are character vectors that ship with stringr for practicing. We will use them extensively in the following examples.*


#### Your turn

Head over to the stringr cheat sheet and begin looking through the functions on the first page. Try answering the following questions?

+ What does str_sub() do? Give an example of when this might be helpful.
- str_sub extracts a substring from a character vector.

+ What does str_trim() do? Whatâ€™s the opposite of str_trim()?
- 

+ How can you tell how many characters are in a string?
- 

Let's learn about some of these functions in more detail.

### Detect or filter on a target string

Determine presence/absence of a literal string with `str_detect()`. Spoiler: later we see `str_detect()` also detects regular expressions.

Which fruits actually use the word "fruit"?

```{r}
str_detect(fruit, pattern = "fruit")
```

What's the easiest way to get the actual fruits that match? Use `str_subset()` to keep only the matching elements. Note we are storing this new vector `my_fruit` to use in later examples!

```{r}
(my_fruit <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "fruit"))
```

#### Your turn

__Exercise 1:__ Which fruits in the `fruits` vector contain the letter "b"?

```{r}
sum(str_detect(fruit, pattern="b"))
```


__Exercise 2:__ Which words in the `words` vector contain the letters "ly"?

```{r}
str_subset(words, pattern="ly")
```




### String splitting by delimiter

Use `stringr::str_split()` to split strings on a delimiter. Some of our fruits are compound words, like "grapefruit", but some have two words, like "ugli fruit". Here we split on a single space `" "`, but show use of a regular expression later. 

```{r}
str_split(my_fruit, pattern = " ")
```

It's bummer that we get a *list* back. But it must be so! In full generality, split strings must return list, because who knows how many pieces there will be?

If you are willing to commit to the number of pieces, you can use `str_split_fixed()` and get a character matrix. You're welcome!

```{r}
str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = " ", n = 2)
```

If the to-be-split variable lives in a data frame, `tidyr::separate()` will split it into 2 or more variables.

```{r}
my_fruit_df <- tibble(my_fruit)
my_fruit_df %>% 
  separate(my_fruit, into = c("pre", "post"), sep = " ")
```


#### Your turn

Suppose you have a data frame of user info containing names and email addresses:

```{r}
full_names <- c("Granger, Hermione", "Potter, Harry", "Weasley, Ron")

emails <- c("hgranger@hogwarts.edu", "hpotter@hogwarts.edu", "rweasley@hogwarts.edu")
```


__Exercise 1:__ How can you create separate columns for the first name and last name?

```{r}
full_names_df = tibble(full_names)
name_last_name = full_names_df %>% separate(full_names, into=c("last_name","name"), sep = ", ")
name_last_name
```


__Exercise 2:__ How can you pull out just the user name (e.g. hgranger) from the email address? 

```{r}
str_split_fixed(emails, pattern="@",n=2)[,1]
```

__Exercise 3:__ Suppose we want to make bruschetta and we have the list of ingredients as a single element, as below. Split each ingredient into a separate component and then sort the ingredients alphabetically. Print the result. 

```{r}
ingredients <- "bread, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, tomatoes, garlic, basil"
splitted = str_split(ingredients, pattern=", ")
str_sort(splitted[[1]])
```


### Substring extraction (and replacement) by position

Count characters in your strings with `str_length()`. Note this is different from the length of the character vector itself.

```{r}
length(my_fruit)
str_length(my_fruit)
```

You can snip out substrings based on character position with `str_sub()`.

```{r}
head(fruit) %>% 
  str_sub(1, 3)
```

The `start` and `end` arguments are vectorised. __Example:__ a sliding 3-character window.

```{r}
tibble(fruit) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  mutate(snip = str_sub(fruit, 1:6, 3:8))
```

Finally, `str_sub()` also works for assignment, i.e. on the left hand side of `<-`.

```{r}
(x <- head(fruit, 3))
str_sub(x, 1, 3) <- "AAA"
x
```


#### Your turn

Consider the `sentences` vector, which contains 720 common sentences used for standardized testing of voice. 

```{r}
head(sentences)
```

__Exercise 1:__ When analyzing writing style for authors, we are often interested in understanding the typical sentence length. Find the average number of characters per sentence for the sentences vector. 

```{r}
sum(str_length(sentences))/length(sentences)
```


__Exercise 2:__ Suppose you have a vector of dates in your data set, in the format YYYY-MM-DD. We would like to pull out the year from this date. While it's possible to do this using special date functions, can you accomplish the same thing using str_sub()?

```{r}
my_dates <- c("2019-01-20", "2020-07-04", "2021-11-11")
str_sub(my_dates, start=1,end=4)
```


__Exercise 3:__ Revisit the earlier example about email addresses and user names. Can you extract just the user name, without keeping the rest of the email address? 

```{r}
emails
str_split_fixed(emails, pattern="@",n=2)[,1]
```


### Collapse a vector

You can collapse a character vector of length `n > 1` to a single string with `str_c()`, which also has other uses (see the [next section](#catenate-vectors)).


```{r}
head(fruit) %>% 
  str_c(collapse = ", ")
```

### Create a character vector by catenating multiple vectors {#catenate-vectors}

If you have two or more character vectors of the same length, you can glue them together element-wise, to get a new vector of that length. Here are some ... awful smoothie flavors?

```{r}
str_c(fruit[1:4], fruit[5:8], sep = " & ")
```

Element-wise catenation can be combined with collapsing.

```{r}
str_c(fruit[1:4], fruit[5:8], sep = " & ", collapse = ", ")
```

If the to-be-combined vectors are variables in a data frame, you can use `tidyr::unite()` to make a single new variable from them.

```{r}
fruit_df <- tibble(
  fruit1 = fruit[1:4],
  fruit2 = fruit[5:8]
)
fruit_df %>% 
  unite("flavor_combo", fruit1, fruit2, sep = " & ")
```

#### Your turn

__Exercise 1.__ In your own words, explain the difference between sep and collapse arguments in the str_c() function. Consider the following for help:

```{r}
vec1 <- c("a", "b", "c")
vec2 <- c("x", "y", "z")

str_c(vec1, sep = ", ")
str_c(vec1, collapse = ", ")

str_c(vec1, vec2, sep = ", ")
str_c(vec1, vec2, collapse = ", ")

str_c(vec1, vec2, sep = ", ", collapse = " ||| ")

```

Sep, "zips" (python terminology) multiple vectors, creates a vector with a length of the longest vector. Vector lengths does not have to be the same.

Collapse, "joins" (again, python) a vector to ONE STRING, seperating with the given seperator. If given two strings, it first joins the values and then separates using the separator.

__Exercise 2:__ Suppose we want to make bruschetta, but we need to clean up the list of ingredients first. 

a. Write code that turns a vector (e.g. `my_vec <- c("a", "b", "c")`) into the single string "a, b, and c". Assume my_vec has at least 3 elements, but possibly more. 

```{r}
my_vec <- c("a", "b", "c")

paste0(str_c(my_vec[1:length(my_vec)-1], collapse = ", "),", and ", my_vec[length(my_vec)])
```


b. Then test your code with the vector of ingredients below, to print them out in the above format. 


```{r}
ingredients <- c("bread", "olive oil", "balsamic vinegar", "tomatoes", "garlic", "basil")

my_vec = ingredients
paste0(str_c(my_vec[1:length(my_vec)-1], collapse = ", "),", and ", my_vec[length(my_vec)])
```


### Substring replacement 

You can replace a pattern with `str_replace()`. Here we use an explicit string-to-replace, but later we revisit with a regular expression.

```{r}
str_replace(my_fruit, pattern = "fruit", replacement = "THINGY")
```

A special case that comes up a lot is replacing `NA`, for which there is `str_replace_na()`.

```{r}
melons <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "melon")
melons[2] <- NA
melons
str_replace_na(melons, "UNKNOWN MELON")
```

If the `NA`-afflicted variable lives in a data frame, you can use `tidyr::replace_na()`.

```{r}
tibble(melons) %>% 
  replace_na(replace = list(melons = "UNKNOWN MELON"))
```


#### Your turn

Suppose we have a variable containing dates. If the year of measurement is unknown, it is replaced with 9999. 

Split the dates below into separate strings for year, month, and date. Then replace any 9999 years with "UNKNOWN".

```{r}
my_dates <- c("2019-01-20", "2020-07-04", "9999-11-11")
my_dates = str_replace(my_dates, pattern="9999", replacement="UNKNOWN")

my_dates_df <- tibble(my_dates)
my_dates_df %>% 
  separate(my_dates, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")
```

And that concludes our treatment of regex-free manipulations of character data!

## Regular expressions with stringr

### Load gapminder

The country names in the `gapminder` dataset are convenient for examples. Load it now and store the `r nlevels(gapminder::gapminder$country)` unique country names to the object `countries`.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
countries <- levels(gapminder$country)
```

### Characters with special meaning

Frequently your string tasks cannot be expressed in terms of a fixed string, but can be described in terms of a **pattern**. Regular expressions, aka "regexes", are the standard way to specify these patterns. In regexes, specific characters and constructs take on special meaning in order to match multiple strings.

The first metacharacter is the period `.`, which stands for any single character, except a newline (which by the way, is represented by `\n`). The regex `a.b` will match all countries that have an `a`, followed by any single character, followed by `b`. Yes, regexes are case sensitive, i.e. "Italy" does not match.

```{r}
str_subset(countries, pattern = "i.a")
```

Notice that `i.a` matches "ina", "ica", "ita", and more.

**Anchors** can be included to express where the expression must occur within the string. The `^` indicates the beginning of string and `$` indicates the end.

Note how the regex `i.a$` matches many fewer countries than `i.a` alone. Likewise, more elements of `my_fruit` match `d` than `^d`, which requires "d" at string start.

```{r}
str_subset(countries, pattern = "i.a$")
str_subset(my_fruit, pattern = "d")
str_subset(my_fruit, pattern = "^d")
```

The metacharacter `\b` indicates a **word boundary** and `\B` indicates NOT a word boundary. This is our first encounter with something called "escaping" and right now I just want you at accept that we need to prepend a second backslash to use these sequences in regexes in R. We'll come back to this tedious point later.

```{r}
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "melon")
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "\\bmelon")
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "\\Bmelon")
```


#### Your turn

__Exercise 1.__ The `words` vector in the `stringr` package has a list of 980 common words in English. 

a. Find all the three letter words in the words vector that begin with s and end with y. 
```{r}

```

b. How many words end with "ing"? What words are these? 

```{r}

```

c. How many words end with "ise"? What words are these? 

```{r}

```


### Character classes

Characters can be specified via classes. Character classes are usually given inside square brackets, `[]` but a few come up so often that we have a metacharacter for them, such as `\d` for a single digit.

Here we match `ia` at the end of the country name, preceded by one of the characters in the class. Or, in the negated class, preceded by anything but one of those characters.

```{r}
## make a class "by hand"
str_subset(countries, pattern = "[nls]ia$")
## use ^ to negate the class
str_subset(countries, pattern = "[^nls]ia$")
```

Here we revisit splitting `my_fruit` with two more general ways to match whitespace: the `\s` metacharacter and the POSIX class `[:space:]`. Notice that we must prepend an extra backslash `\` to escape `\s` and the POSIX class has to be surrounded by two sets of square brackets.

```{r}
## remember this?
# str_split_fixed(fruit, pattern = " ", n = 2)
## alternatives
str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = "\\s", n = 2)
str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = "[[:space:]]", n = 2)
```

Let's see the country names that contain punctuation.

```{r}
str_subset(countries, "[[:punct:]]")
```

#### Your turn

Suppose we have the following paragraph containing several sentences. We'd like to split up the paragraph into separate sentences. Will the following approach work? Why or why not? Brainstorm ways to address this problem. 

```{r}
my_para <- "This chapter introduces you to string manipulation in R. Youâ€™ll learn the basics of how strings work and how to create them by hand, but the focus of this chapter will be on regular expressions, or regexps for short. Regular expressions are useful because strings usually contain unstructured or semi-structured data, and regexps are a concise language for describing patterns in strings. They can be frustrating, but be patient! When you first look at a regexp, youâ€™ll think a cat walked across your keyboard, but as your understanding improves they will soon start to make sense."

str_split(my_para, "[[:punct:]]")

```


### Quantifiers

You can decorate characters (and other constructs, like metacharacters and classes) with information about how many characters they are allowed to match.

| quantifier | meaning   | quantifier | meaning                    |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------|
| *          | 0 or more | {n}        | exactly n                  |
| +          | 1 or more | {n,}       | at least n                 |
| ?          | 0 or 1    | {,m}       | at most m                  |
|            |           | {n,m}      | between n and m, inclusive |

Explore these by inspecting matches for `l` followed by `e`, allowing for various numbers of characters in between.

`l.*e` will match strings with 0 or more characters in between, i.e. any string with an `l` eventually followed by an `e`. This is the most inclusive regex for this example, so we store the result as `matches` to use as a baseline for comparison.

```{r}
(matches <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.*e"))
```

Change the quantifier from `*` to `+` to require at least one intervening character. The strings that no longer match: all have a literal `le` with no preceding `l` and no following `e`.

```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.+e")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.+e")))
```

Change the quantifier from `*` to `?` to require at most one intervening character. In the strings that no longer match, the shortest gap between `l` and following `e` is at least two characters.

```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.?e")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.?e")))
```

Finally, we remove the quantifier and allow for no intervening characters. The strings that no longer match lack a literal `le`.

```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "le")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "le")))
```

#### Your turn

__Exercise 1:__ Earlier, we found all the three-letter words that begin with s and end with y. Now, find all words of *any* length that begin with s and end with y. 

```{r}

```

__Exercise 2.__ Find all the words that begin with a vowel (aeiou). There are a lot of them, so rather than printing them all out, print out the number of words that meet this condition. 

```{r}

```


__Exercise 3.__ Challenge: Find all the words that do not contain a vowel.  (e.g. "dry")

```{r}

```


### Escaping

You've probably caught on by now that there are certain characters with special meaning in regexes, including `$ * + . ? [ ] ^ { } | ( ) \`.

What if you really need the plus sign to be a literal plus sign and not a regex quantifier? You will need to *escape* it by prepending a backslash. But wait ... there's more! Before a regex is interpreted as a regular expression, it is also interpreted by R as a string. And backslash is used to escape there as well. So, in the end, you need to preprend two backslashes in order to match a literal plus sign in a regex.

This will be more clear with examples!

#### Escapes in plain old strings

Here is routine, non-regex use of backslash `\` escapes in plain vanilla R strings. We intentionally use `cat()` instead of `print()` here.

* To escape quotes inside quotes:
    ```{r}
    cat("Do you use \"airquotes\" much?")
    ```
    Sidebar: eliminating the need for these escapes is exactly why people use double quotes inside single quotes and *vice versa*.    
    
* To insert newline (`\n`) or tab (`\t`):
    ```{r}
    cat("before the newline\nafter the newline")
    cat("before the tab\tafter the tab")
    ```

#### Escapes in regular expressions

Examples of using escapes in regexes to match characters that would otherwise have a special interpretation.

We know several `gapminder` country names contain a period. How do we isolate them? Although it's tempting, this command `str_subset(countries, pattern = ".")` won't work!

```{r}
## cheating using a POSIX class ;)
str_subset(countries, pattern = "[[:punct:]]")
## using two backslashes to escape the period
str_subset(countries, pattern = "\\.")
```

A last example that matches an actual square bracket.

```{r end_char_vectors}
(x <- c("whatever", "X is distributed U[0,1]"))
str_subset(x, pattern = "\\[")
```

You can also use the "|" operator (OR) when searching for patterns. 

```{r}
str_subset(countries, pattern = "\\.")
str_subset(countries, pattern = "\\.|,")
```


#### Your turn

__Exercise 1:__ Find all the sentences in `sentences` that contain an apostrophe. 

```{r}

```


__Exercise 2:__ Consider the set of colors below. How many sentences contain one of these colors? Which sentences contain colors? 

```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
```
